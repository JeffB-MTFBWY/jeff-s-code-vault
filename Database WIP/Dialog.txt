Welcome to this crazy, noisy, bizarre town!
Hi! How can I help you?
It's been a while since we've had visitors.
Ah! A stranger! Welcome.
The king has been acting strange lately...
I know I had it around here somewhere!
Hey...you look.....familiar....
Welcome to Corneria.
An adventurer? In these parts?
Someday, I'm gonna leave this town and never look back!
I'm just a simple being: All I want is all the money in the world!
Well...here we go again. 
I don't have anything to say right now.
Excuse me. I don't have time to talk to strangers right now.
